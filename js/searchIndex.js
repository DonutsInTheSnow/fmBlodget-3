Last year it was May 3rd. In business management, break-even point is the amount of sales necessary to begin making a profit. Think of break-even point as leverage. If your business has a lower break-even point it can, with less effort, be more profitable. When a business has a higher break-even point, it must accomplish more sales just to begin making a profit. One of the ways to lower your break-even point is to lower your fixed costs. These expenses are items that are not affected by sales. Rent, utilities, vehicle expense, maintenance and loan interest are some examples. These expenses need to be paid regardless of sales. The other way to lower your break-even point is to increase your profit margin. This may not necessarily mean you must increase your prices. Profit margin can also be improved by lowering your cost of goods sold. Sometimes you can acquire more favorable terms from a supplier or perhaps shipping or material costs can be reduced. Remember, a company that has higher profit margins and lower fixed costs will clearly have an advantage. To calculate your break-even point, just divide your fixed costs by your profit margin. This will give you the sales per month (or year) that you must achieve to begin making a profit.",

              content: "Having a bookkeeper can be a great help to many businesses. Often, either a full or part time bookkeeper can leave you with additional time to spend on important aspects of your business. With careful selection, these people can provide skilled bookkeeping and valuable reports. In many small businesses, the bookkeeper may provide all of the accounting functions. This may seem like a good idea but can be perilous. Good business management should always involve some internal control structure. This primarily involves the separation of duties for: authorization, record keeping and custody of assets. Some basic measures are explained below. I recall a forensic audit of a small business who had complete faith and confidence in a bookkeeper/office manager. This person had control over the entire accounting system (QuickBooks), the checking account, bank statements and a signature stamp. Unfortunately it was relatively easy for the bookkeeper to cover her tracks. This took place over a period of almost a year. The final amount embezzled was over $35,000. In larger companies some assurance is maintained by separating duties between employees. The theory is that more than one employee would have to conspire in order to embezzle. If you cannot separate all of the duties of the accounting functions, some important lessons can be learned. You, the business owner, should receive your bank statement (or credit card statement) directly at your home or post office. Go through every check (or charge). Does the amount seem reasonable? Do you recognize the vendor? Are the checks signed by you? If it is necessary to have a signature stamp, is it accessible to only you? These steps, and others, can keep your business from being a target.",

              content: "Generally, there are two methods of deducting business use of a vehicle. 1. The “actual expenses” method involves keeping records of all expenses related to your vehicle such as gas, maintenance, and depreciation. On a newer vehicle, the larger depreciation gives typically a larger deduction (early in the depreciated life) over that of the “mileage method”. After the end of the depreciation on the vehicle, your only deductions would be gas, maintenance, insurance etc. Depreciation can run as long as 5 years, typically is accelerated and starts when the vehicle was “placed in service” for business use. Other options for depreciation include expensing elections that further increase deductions in the first year(s). See Expensing Vehicles for more information. Remember that you still need to keep a log of your business mileage. Even if you use the “actual expense” method, you need to have documentation of your business use. Mileage logs provide a method of allocation of expenses between business and personal. 2. The second method is to use the “standard mileage rate”. This method involves multiplying your business miles by a rate determined by the IRS. Publication 463 lists the standard mileage rates for the prior year. These change every year and sometimes more than once a year. This is supposed to provide a deduction that, on average, is equal to the actual expenses of running an auto, including depreciation, repairs, gas etc. If you use your vehicle for personal use, keep a log of your business miles. Remember to keep track of tolls, parking, town tax and interest on your auto loan . These are deductible (for the business portion) under either method. Variations on the methods above include switching from one method to the other. One restriction for switching is that you must have used straight-line depreciation under the “actual expense” method to switch to the “mileage method”. You can imagine scenarios where one method would be advantageous over the other. The “actual expense” method might provide a greater deduction with a new vehicle when depreciation expense is high. The “mileage method” might prove better for an older vehicle that is reliable and has few repairs.",

Other, more limited expensing elections are available for vehicles under 6000# GVW. One drawback of this election is that there are no remaining deductions for depreciation in the following years (if you elect to expense the entire amount). If business income increases, you may be paying a higher percentage of tax in following years. Still many businesses have the most need for cash in the early years of their business.",

Under the accrual method, you record income when you earn it (even though you may not receive payment until later), and you record expenses when you incur them (even though you may not pay them until later). Note: If your annual sales are greater than $1 million and you carry inventory in your business, you must: Use the accrual method of accounting. Deduct your inventory expenses only when you sell those items, rather than when you buy them. Cash basis is a method of bookkeeping in which you regard income or expenses as occurring at the time you actually receive a payment or pay a bill. A cash-basis report shows income only if you have received it, and expenses only if you have paid them. For example, if you have not yet received a payment for an invoice, a cash-basis report on your sales will not include the amount of the invoice. Under the cash method of accounting, income is recorded when you actually receive it, and expenses are recorded when you actually pay them. Buying Assets In lieu of depreciation, business taxpayers may elect to immediately expense (IRS Code Section 179), rather than depreciate, a certain dollar amount of the total price of equipment or furniture purchased each year, with certain limitations. With limitations, this also applies to business vehicles. For more information, see Expensing Vehicles. For tax year 2003, this total was $100,000. If you have a loss from your business, see the first bullet below. If your business is showing a loss, you may run into some limitations when expensing your equipment purchases. However, you can include any business income, including wages, when figuring whether you have a loss from your business income. For tax year 2003, the $100 000 amount was reduced if you purchase more than $400,000 worth of equipment during the year. Keep track of your start-up costs (those costs you incur before you are ready to receive customers) separately. These must be deducted over 5 years, instead of expensing them in the first year of business.",

This is supposed to provide a deduction that, on average, is equal to the actual expenses of running an auto, including depreciation. Remember to keep a log of your business mileage. Even if you use the “actual expenses” method, you should have documentation of your business use. Mileage logs also provide a method of allocation of expenses between business and personal use .

If the IRS questions any withdrawals, it is the sole responsibility of the accountholder to prove expenditures were for qualified medical expenses. You can track all of your qualified medical expenses online, avoiding any potential tax problems. We provide the ability to enter those expenses that won't automatically be listed online, like eyeglasses and weight-loss programs. Accountholders have the capability of entering claims for reimbursement of qualified medical expenses directly into the HSATool website through their account. Directly entered claims can then be monitored online to determine payment status. The Direct Entry feature is available in addition to the online feature allowing the accountholder to select HDHP-processed claims with outstanding member liability balances for payment. How are disbursements from an HSA taxed? HSA disbursements used to pay for qualified medical expenses of the accountholder (or spouse/ dependents) are not taxed. Any amount of the disbursements not used to pay for qualified medical expenses is subject to ordinary tax plus an additional 10% penalty. This penalty does not apply in the case of distributions made after the accountholder's death, disability, or attaining age 65. How are disbursements taxed if I am no longer eligible for an HSA? If the accountholder is no longer eligible for an HSA (e.g., he/she is over age 65 and entitled to Medicare benefits, or no longer has a high deductible health plan), distributions used to pay for qualified medical expenses are still tax-free. If distributions are used to pay for items other than qualified medical expenses, then they are taxed as ordinary income (and subject to the 10% penalty).",

For medical expenses incurred at a PPO provider, accountholders should wait to receive their Explanation of Benefits statement, which may include PPO provider discounts that can save them money. Can the debit card be used for other purchases or to obtain cash? The card is intended to be used solely for qualified medical expenses (as defined above). The card will not work for cash withdrawals at ATM locations.

Even if the health plan is no longer a qualified high deductible health plan, accountholders can still withdraw previously contributed HSA money to pay for qualified medical expenses, or continue to let the funds grow tax-deferred. Accountholders cannot, however, make contributions to the HSA unless an HSA-qualified insurance plan is in place. What are the income tax consequences after the HSA accountholder's death?Upon death, any balance remaining in the HSA becomes the property of a beneficiary named in the HSA paperwork. If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse, distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to ordinary income tax. If the beneficiary is a person other than the surviving spouse, the HSA ceases to be an HSA as of the date of the accountholder's death, and the beneficiary is required to include in gross income the fair market value of the HSA assets as of the date of death. This amount is reduced by any payments from the HSA made for the accountholder's qualified medical expenses, if paid within one year after death. What reporting is required for an HSA? Employer contributions to an HSA must be reported on the employee's Form W-2. The IRS will release forms and instructions, similar to those required for MSAs, on how to report HSA contributions, deductions, and distributions (withdrawals).",

Because HSAs must be coupled with a high deductible health plan, the health insurance premiums can be substantially lower. Employers often find that these premium savings are large enough to cover the HSA contributions they make on behalf of their employees, without increasing their current outlay for health care benefits. If the employer gives employees a bonus, can this amount be put into the HSA? Bonuses may be given and employees can choose to deposit some or all the amount into their HSA (as long as the maximum annual contribution is not exceeded). Can the amount of employer funding vary based on classes of employees? No, there are comparability rules that must be followed when funding the HSA. In general, the employer must make available comparable contributions on behalf of all employees with comparable coverage during the same period. Contributions are considered comparable if they are either the same amount or the same percentage of the deductible under the plan.",

If the HSA is not set up with a cafeteria plan, an employee may make contributions with a check. What happens if a claim is incurred after the employee's policy add-on date, but prior to the HSA effective date? For contribution purposes, the HSA is effective the first of the month following an employee add-on to an HSA plan. Qualified medical expenses will be reimbursed from the HSA retroactive to the date the employee was added to the HSA plan. Example: An employee who is added to the policy on 2/15 can begin contributing to the HSA on 3/1, but will still be reimbursed for services rendered on 2/20. What happens to the HSA balance if the employee leaves the company? The HSA belongs to the employee. Therefore, unspent HSA funds remain with the individual. Accountholders can still use their HSA money to pay for qualified medical expenses, or continue to let it grow tax-deferred. Accountholders cannot, however, contribute to the HSA unless an HSA qualified insurance plan is in place.",
