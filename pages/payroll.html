                    <p>Now you can trust your payroll is in good hands. There's nothing better than personal attention from someone who knows your business. Our first-rate payroll service is customized for you and your business. Visit our payroll website at www.datapayroll.com for more information.</p>

                        <li class="list-group-item">Each payday, tell us your employee hours. We calculate all federal, state, and local taxes, as well as voluntary
                        deductions, such as retirement plan contributions or insurance premiums. It's all guaranteed to be 100% accurate.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Your tax deposits will be on time and correct-every time.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">We complete your federal and state payroll filings for you, including quarterlies, year-end forms and W-2's.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">All of your payroll information will be maintained and available: employee records, past paystubs, tax filings, and
                        records of tax payments.
                        No more IRS penalties!</li>

                        <li class="list-group-item">We can classify your employees by the types of work they do. Did you know that you can save a significant amount of
                        insurance cost by classifying your employees? If your employees do different types of tasks, some of their work might be
                        subject to a lower worker's compensation rate. We can track these classifications and take care of your worker's
                        compensation audit.</li>

            <div class="row justify-content-center mx-lg-n5">
                <div class="col-lg-8 py-3 px-lg-5 wow fadeInUp">
                    <p><strong>What do I need to get started?</strong></p>
                    <p>All we need is your company and employee information, and payroll history (if any) for this year. Call us to schedule an
                    appointment to discuss your payroll requirements. We will design a customized payroll solution for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Can I switch payroll providers mid-year?</strong></p>
                    <p>As long as you have records of your payroll history, you can switch at any time. You can also switch from us to another
                    provider at any time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Can I import this information to my accounting software?</strong></p>
                    <p>You can import your payroll data into accounting software such as QuickBooks, QuickBooks Online Edition and Microsoft
                    Money, so all your information is in one place.</p>
                    <p><strong>What about W-2's?</strong></p>
                    <p>At year-end, we create W-2 forms for you and your employees. And we take care of filing them with the Social Security
                    Administration.</p>
                    <p><strong>What if an employee needs a copy of an old pay stub?</strong></p>
                    <p>No problem. We maintain complete records of your payroll data, for quick access whenever you need it.</p>
                    <p><strong>How will I stay on top of my payroll details?</strong></p>
                    <p>We will provide you with a variety of reports that will allow you to remain informed and in control of your payroll.</p>
                    <p id="S-electronicPayments"><strong>How does electronic payment of payroll taxes work?</strong></p>
                    <p>We will schedule tax payments to be made electronically, on time with your approval. No need to worry about due dates or
                    filling out payroll forms again! Go to our Payroll E-Services page for more information.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does direct deposit work?</strong></p>
                    <p>Once your direct deposit is setup, just fax, email or call us with the hours (or salary) for each employee 4 days prior
                    to payday. We will schedule payroll to be direct deposited into each employee(s) bank account with your approval. Our
                    Payroll E-Services page has more information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why are our services more competitive than larger payroll companies?</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not create or mail your payroll checks. Many companies print checks and Fed Ex them to your office. This not only
                    can delay your payroll date but increases costs as well. We email or fax paystubs with withholding and year-to-date
                    information. You provide these along with a check for the net amount to your employee. If you use our Direct Deposit
                    services, you only need to provide a copy of the paystub to your employee and record the amount in your check register.
                    Employees also have the option of receiving their paystubs through a secure website.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5 text-center font-weight-bold">Payroll E-Services</h3>
            <div class="row justify-content-center mx-lg-n5">
                <div class="col-lg-8 py-3 px-lg-5 wow fadeInUp">
                    <p><strong>What is E-Payment? How does it work?</strong></p>
                    <p>E-Payment uses federal EFTPS (Electronic Federal Tax Payment System) for payment of payroll taxes. EFTPS enables you
                    to pay your federal payroll taxes electronically, without the hassle of transcribing data onto paper coupons or
                    delivering payments to your bank. EFTPS saves time and eliminates mistakes.</p>
                    <p>When an electronic federal tax payment is made, a payment record is transmitted to the IRS that contains the amount of
                    the payment, the date of withdrawal, and your EFTPS account information. The IRS confirms receipt of this file and
                    assigns an EFT confirmation number. Then, on the withdrawal date, the IRS debits your bank account for the tax payment
                    amount.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is Direct Deposit and how does it work?</strong></p>
                    <p>Direct Deposit means automatically depositing your employees' net payroll amounts into the employees' bank accounts.
                    Your employees will no longer have to cash or deposit checks to get paid.</p>
                    <p>If you choose Direct Deposit, our service provider will automatically deposit your approved paychecks into your
                    employees' accounts on payday, by way of the Electronic Payments Association (NACHA or ACH), a long-established
                    electronic funds transfer system used by banks. No money is ever transmitted over the Internet.</p>
                    <p>Your direct deposit transactions are processed at 5:00 PM, two banking days before the pay date. You need to ensure that
                    funds are available for payment to your employees by this time. Here is a Form to authorize direct deposit.</p>
                    <p><a href="" alt="">Form for Authorization of Direct Deposit</a>.</p>
                    <p id="S-onceEnrolled"><strong>Once I'm enrolled with Payroll E-Services, will tax payments automatically be scheduled?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, payments are scheduled and notification is provided in advance of the date of payment from your account. These
                    scheduled payments are made on the due date for all your federal payroll taxes. If you wish to cancel a scheduled
                    payment, notify us immediately by phone at least three (3) banking days prior to the scheduled payment. Electronic
                    payments cannot be made to the State of New Hampshire for unemployment compensation.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are payments for state unemployment compensation handled?</strong></p>
                    <p>Tax payments to the State of New Hampshire (for unemployment compensation) cannot be made electronically. We will
                    complete the necessary state forms and notify you of the amount to be paid by check.</p>
                    <p><strong>When can I start using Direct Deposit?</strong></p>
                    <p>You should allow a minimum of two weeks from the time we receive your authorization form and voided check to the date
                    of your first Direct Deposit payroll. Once you confirm the value of our test transaction, we will send you an email with
                    instructions to create your first payroll six (6) banking days before payday.</p>
                    <p><strong>When will funds be withdrawn from my account for Direct Deposit paychecks?</strong></p>
                    <p>With the exception of your first payroll, the fund transfer is initiated at 5:00 PM two banking days before your
                    payroll date. After this fund transfer is initiated, changes or cancellation of payments cannot be made.</p>
                    <p id="S-creditCorrectly"><strong>How do employees know if their bank accounts have been credited correctly?</strong></p>
                    <p>You should give your employees copies of the paystub(s) faxed to you. This paystub will show the day the direct
                    deposit will occur. Employees can also contact their bank to receive confirmation of the deposit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Can I split an employee's Direct Deposit between two different bank accounts?</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">Yes, you can distribute an employee's net pay in a couple of ways and the distribution will be shown on the paystub:
                        <li class="list-group-item">Specify that a fixed amount of the net be deposited in one bank account and the remainder deposited in a second account.
                        The bank accounts can be at the same or different banks.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Specify that a fixed amount of the net be deposited in a bank account and the balance paid by paper check. You will need
                        to write paper check(s) after the paystub(s) are faxed to you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="S-e-file"><strong>What is E-File? How is it different from E-Payment?</strong></p>
                    <p>E-File allows us to file certain quarterly and annual tax returns electronically. This is a separate feature from
                    E-Payment, which allows you to make your tax deposits electronically. Currently, we offer E-Filing for all federal
                    payroll tax forms.</p>
                    <p><strong>What if my pay date falls on a weekend or holiday?</strong></p>
                    <p>If your pay date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, you must send us your payroll information early enough so that
                    employees will receive their net pay on the prior banking day. For example, if your pay date is normally on a Friday,
                    which happens to be a holiday, you must approve payroll by 5:00 P.M. Monday (normally by 5:00 P.M. Tuesday) so that
                    employees receive their pay on Thursday.</p>
                    <p><strong>How much do E-Services cost me?</strong></p>
                    <p>There is no additional fee for using our E-Services. There can be fines imposed in the case of insufficient funds or
                    other exception processing.</p>
