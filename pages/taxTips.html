                    <p><strong>How to "pay yourself" as a member of the LLC</strong></p>
                    <p>As a member of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) your taxable income is determined by your percentage of the LLC's net
                    income at the end of the year. In most circumstances each member of the LLC is self-employed and not an employee. Checks
                    written to LLC members only affects their investment in the LLC and are not a wages. The LLC member can invest or draw
                    as much money as they wish without tax consequence (until the business is sold). You could think of these draws and
                    investments in the LLC as savings accounts. They should be tracked for each member.</p>
                    <p>This scenario is the same for self-employed individuals operating as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs.</p>

                    <p id="S-healthSavings"><strong>Health Savings Accounts</strong></p>
                    <p>Would you like to Deduct the Cost of Out-of-Pocket Medical Expenses? Are you interested in affordable health insurance
                    while providing a tax benefit as well? As health insurance plans begin to have ever increasing deductibles and
                    exclusions, you might feel like health insurance is not worth it. Health Savings Accounts (HSA's) combined with high
                    deductible health plans (HDHP's) keep your monthly premiums at a minimum while providing a tax deduction for most
                    out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
                    <p>Usually medical expenses are not deductible because they must exceed 7.5% of your AGI (adjusted gross income) and you
                    must itemize deductions. If your interested in additional information on New Hampshire's Assurant Health and how this
                    works see <a href="#healthSavingsAccounts" alt="health savings account info">Health Savings Account Information</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Business or Hobby?</strong></p>
                    <p>Is you business continuing to show losses year after year? Make sure you pay attention to guidelines setup by the IRS to
                    determine if your business is really a business or may be considered a hobby. The IRS may determine that losses and/or
                    certain expenses be disallowed. See <a href="#businessOrHobby" alt="business or hobby"></a>Business or Hobby to learn how your business measures up.</p>

                    <p id="S-fileExtension"><strong>Filing an Extension</strong></p>
                    <p>The extension beyond April 15th is automatic if requested. No reason is necessary. However, the extension is only for
                    the tax return, not the amount due. We will need estimate if you have paid adequate amounts of estimated tax payments
                    and withholding to cover the actual tax due. If your payments are not adequate (and you make no other payments before
                    April 15) interest and penalties will be charged. In some cases we can successfully request the waiver of penalties, but
                    interest would be due in any case.</p>
                    <p>If you need help with estimating your liability or filing an extension give us a call.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spread out Gains on Sale of Assets</strong></p>
                    <p>We all probably expect to pay more taxes in a year that we have a large gain. But what most people don’t know is how
                    much your effective tax rate increases. If your adjusted gross income (AGI) is normally $50,000 and you sell a second
                    home, rental property or business and have a gain of $150,000 your tax return will look very different. Your tax would
                    go from approximately $4,400 to $47,100! Your effective tax rate goes from 8.7% to 23.5%. Installment sales are a
                    relatively simple way of reducing this affect. Before finalizing a sale, see us to reduce these taxes. (Remember that
                    some gains on the sale of a principal residence may also be included in income.)</p>

                    <p id="S-bizUseAutos"><strong>Business Use of Autos</strong></p>
                    <p>Generally, there are two methods of deducting business use of a vehicle. The “actual expenses” method involves keeping
                    records of all expenses related to your vehicle such as gas, maintenance, and depreciation. The “standard mileage rate”
                    method involves multiplying your business miles by a rate determined by the IRS. This is supposed to provide a deduction
                    that, on average, is equal to the actual expenses of running an auto, including depreciation. Remember to keep a log of
                    your business mileage. Even if you use the “actual expenses” method, you should have documentation of your business use.
                    Mileage logs also provide a method of allocation of expenses between business and personal use . Remember to keep track
                    of tolls, parking, town tax and interest on your auto loan. These are deductible (for the business portion) under either
                    method. This is a troublesome issue for many small businesses. See <a href="../pages/commonTaxInfo.html#businessUseOfAutos" alt="business use of autos">Business Use of Autos</a> for further information.</p>

                    <p><strong>Estate Planning</strong></p>
                    <p>Estate planning continues to be an issue for anyone with significant assets. Estate tax will probably not go away.
                    Without planning, your estate may pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more than necessary. Estate planning can be
                    inexpensive and can provide your heirs with huge benefits. Estate planning can also serve many other purposes besides
                    minimizing estate tax. Other purposes include succession planning for businesses, control of assets passed to
                    beneficiaries, and providing for loved ones that may be less than capable.</p>

                    <p id="S-expensingAssets"><strong>Expensing Certain Assets</strong></p>
                    <p>Typically business assets with a life of more than 1 year must be depreciated (expensed over time). Section 179 of the
                    Internal Revenue Code allows you to expense all or part of the cost in the year the asset was purchased. Vehicles may be
                    expensed as well. In some situations it is possible to deduct the entire cost of a vehicle in the first year. For more
                    information see <a href="../pages/commonTaxInfo.html#expensingVehicles" alt="expensing vehicles">Expensing Vehicles</a>. This deduction cannot exceed $105,000 (for 2005) and cannot exceed the
                    income derived from the business. Any excess amount can be carried over to the next year. This deduction is also phased
                    out for businesses with asset purchases over $420,000 per year.</p>

                    <p><strong>Do you use the Standard Deduction?</strong></p>
                    <p>If your itemized deductions come close to the standard deduction, consider timing your itemized deductions so that they
                    are lumped together every other year. Pay 2 years of property tax within 1 calendar year by paying one payment late
                    (January and December of the same calendar year). Do the same for contributions. Every other year you will be able to
                    itemize and reduce your tax. On the alternate years, you will use the standard deduction.</p>
                    <p>Other itemized deductions include medical (limited), mortgage interest, and unreimbused employee expenses (limited).
                    These typically are harder to time the payment to your advantage.</p>

                    <p><strong>What is a Health Savings Account ( HSA )?</strong></p>
                    <p>An HSA is a tax-favored savings account that allows funds to be accumulated tax-free to pay for current and future
                    qualified healthcare expenses. HSAs were made possible by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
                    Act of 2003.</p>

                    <p><strong>Who can establish an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Most people with a qualified high deductible health insurance plan may establish an HSA. To be eligible, an individual
                    must also:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>not be covered under a health plan that does not have a high deductible*;</li>
                        <li>not be entitled to benefits under Medicare; and</li>
                        <li>not be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return. An HSA is established with an HSA trustee or custodian
                        (usually an insurance company or bank (much the same way that IRAs are established).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>* Exceptions to this rule are "permitted insurance exceptions." The permitted exceptions are: Worker's Compensation,
                    Tort Liabilities, Property and Casualty, Insurance for Specific Disease or Illness or Insurance that pays a fixed amount
                    per day of hospitalization.</p>

                    <p id="S-highDeductible"><strong>What is a high deductible health plan (HDHP)?</strong></p>
                    <p>Generally, a high deductible health plan satisfies certain requirements with respect to deductibles and out-of-pocket
                    expenses.</p>

                    <p id="contributions" class="lead text-center"><strong>Contributions</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Who may contribute to an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Individuals, employers and their employees.</p>

                    <p><strong>Can the employer and employee make contributions to the HSA at the same time?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, federal regulations allow for both the employer and the employee to make HSA contributions to an account in any one
                    tax year.</p>

                    <p id="S-hsaContribution"><strong>How is money contributed to the HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Contributions may be made in one lump sum or in regular installments by the employer, the employee or both.</p>

                    <p><strong>How much can be contributed to an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">For more information see  <a href="" alt="">contributions limits</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What happens if more money is contributed than allowed?</strong></p>
                    <p>To avoid a tax penalty, a refund of excess contributions plus interest must be requested through the HSA administrator.
                    These excess funds must be taken out of the HSA by the date taxes are due or by April 15th of the following year,
                    whichever comes first. It is the responsibility of the accountholder to not exceed the maximum allowed.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happens if the account holder or employer forgets to make an HSA contribution?</strong></p>
                    <p>Contributions can be posted to the HSA any time before April 15th or when taxes are posted the following year.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happens to the HSA balance at the end of the year?</strong></p>
                    <p>Unspent HSA funds roll over each year and belong to the accountholder. There is no "use it or lose it" provision with
                    HSAs. These funds can continue to be used for qualified medical expenses, along with any new contributions.</p>

                    <p id="S-hsaTaxTreatment"><strong>What is the tax treatment of HSA contributions?</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Employer contributions made to an HSA are tax deductible.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Employee contributions made to an HSA are tax deductible. The contributions are deductible whether or not the eligible
                        individual itemizes deductions. HSA contributions may not, however, also be deducted as medical expenses.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">If an employee is contributing through a cafeteria plan, contributions are made before taxes and the employer saves on
                        FICA taxes as well.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Are rollover contributions to HSAs permitted?</strong></p>
                    <p>Rollover contributions from a Medical Savings Account (MSA) and other HSAs are permitted. Rollover contributions need
                    not be in cash. Rollovers are not subject to the annual contribution limits. Rollovers from an IRA, a Health
                    Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), or a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) are not permitted. State specific rules may also
                    apply, please see your tax advisor for more information.</p>

                    <p id="S-flexSpending"><strong>If the account is funded monthly and I incur an expense, which exceeds the amount currently in the account, can I
                    withdraw the full amount of the expense like with a Flexible Spending Account?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, the maximum you can withdraw is the amount currently in the account. After additional deposits are made to the HSA,
                    you may then make more withdrawals to reimburse yourself or pay the balance of the bill.</p>

                    <p><strong>Are HSA accumulations tax-free or tax-deferred?</strong></p>
                    <p>HSA accumulations are tax-free if used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Accumulations are tax deferred if they are
                    held in the account until the age of 65 and then used for purposes other than qualified medical expenses.</p>

                    <p><strong>If I have an HDHP with family coverage, but my spouse is not covered under that plan or other family coverage, can I
                    still contribute to the family maximum under the my plan?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, if the spouse files a joint tax return or agrees to aggregate their contribution maximums that way. Otherwise, the
                    accountholder's contribution maximum will be one-half of the family maximum under the employee's plan.</p>

                    <p><strong>If my family is not covered under my qualified HDHP, can I still use my HSA account to pay their qualified expenses?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, the accountholder may use HSA funds to pay the qualified expenses of the dependents listed (claimed) on income
                    taxes.</p>

                    <p><strong>What can HSA funds be used for?</strong></p>
                    <p>Funds can be withdrawn for any purpose. However, if not withdrawn for qualified medical expenses by someone under age
                    65, the amount withdrawn is taxable and subject to a 10% penalty by the IRS. After age 65, there is no penalty for

                    <p><strong>Are health insurance premiums considered qualified medical expenses?</strong></p>
                    <p>The following types of insurance premiums count as qualified medical expenses under an HSA:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">COBRA health care continuation coverage</li>

                    <p>* Medicare is a federal Health Insurance Program for people 65 years of age and older, some disabled people under 65
                    years of age, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure treated with dialysis or a transplant).
                    A Medicare Supplement policy is a health insurance policy sold by private insurance companies to fill "gaps" in original
                    Medical Plan coverage.</p>

                    <p id="S-qualifiedMedical"><strong>Are HSA withdrawals monitored to make sure they are for qualified medical expenses?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, the accountholder is responsible for determining if withdrawals are for qualified medical expenses. If the IRS
                    questions any withdrawals, it is the sole responsibility of the accountholder to prove expenditures were for qualified
                    medical expenses. You can track all of your qualified medical expenses online, avoiding any potential tax problems. We
                    provide the ability to enter those expenses that won't automatically be listed online, like eyeglasses and weight-loss
                    programs. Accountholders have the capability of entering claims for reimbursement of qualified medical expenses directly
                    into the HSATool website through their account. Directly entered claims can then be monitored online to determine
                    payment status. The Direct Entry feature is available in addition to the online feature allowing the accountholder to
                    select HDHP-processed claims with outstanding member liability balances for payment.</p>

                    <p><strong>How are disbursements from an HSA taxed?</strong></p>
                    <p>HSA disbursements used to pay for qualified medical expenses of the accountholder (or spouse/ dependents) are not taxed.
                    Any amount of the disbursements not used to pay for qualified medical expenses is subject to ordinary tax plus an
                    additional 10% penalty. This penalty does not apply in the case of distributions made after the accountholder's death,
                    disability, or attaining age 65.</p>

                    <p><strong>How are disbursements taxed if I am no longer eligible for an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>If the accountholder is no longer eligible for an HSA (e.g., he/she is over age 65 and entitled to Medicare benefits, or
                    no longer has a high deductible health plan), distributions used to pay for qualified medical expenses are still
                    tax-free. If distributions are used to pay for items other than qualified medical expenses, then they are taxed as
                    ordinary income (and subject to the 10% penalty).</p>

                    <p><strong>How can I access my HSA funds?</strong></p>
                    <p>Assurant Health offers two easy ways to access HSA funds:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Debit Card: The free HSA VISA debit card can be used to conveniently pay for prescription drugs at point of service
                        and for other medical expenses that will not be discounted by the PPO network. The card is valid wherever VISA is
                        accepted. Claim forms are not needed and there are no transaction fees.</li>
                        <li>Checkbook: Accountholders receive free start-up checks to pay for medical expenses directly from their HSA. Claim
                        forms are not needed and there are no transaction fees. Additional checks can be obtained for a small fee.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>For medical expenses incurred at a PPO provider, accountholders should wait to receive their Explanation of Benefits
                    statement, which may include PPO provider discounts that can save them money.</p>

                    <p><strong>Can the debit card be used for other purchases or to obtain cash?</strong></p>
                    <p>The card is intended to be used solely for qualified medical expenses (as defined above). The card will not work for
                    cash withdrawals at ATM locations. If the IRS questions any withdrawals, it is the responsibility of the accountholder
                    to justify expenditures as qualified medical expenses. We strongly encourage all HSA accountholders to keep receipts and
                    diligent transaction records.</p>

                    <p id="S-hsaStatements"><strong>Do HSA accountholders receive statements?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, monthly statements including contributions and disbursements are sent to the accountholders. Statements also
                    include debit card transactions with purchase amount and place of purchase. These statements are also available for
                    viewing online by selecting the Health Savings Account on the HSA Summary Page.</p>

                    <p><strong>If I change from single to family coverage or vice versa, or have another life event change, how is the HSA affected?</strong></p>
                    <p>If the HSA plan is affected by a change in policy status, the amount available to fund in the HSA will change as well.
                    View online the HSA Savings Illustrator to better reflect how this change impacts you and your maximum allowable amount.</p>

                    <p><strong>Does Assurant Health allow clients/individuals to invest their HSA funds using their own Custodian?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, this is not feasible since reporting links have to be set up with the custodian to transfer money.</p>
                    <p><strong>Is there a minimum amount required to open an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Assurant Health does not require a minimum amount to open an HSA.</p>

                    <p id="miscellaneous" class="lead text-center">Miscellaneous<strong></strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What happens to the HSA if the health plan changes?</strong></p>
                    <p>Even if the health plan is no longer a qualified high deductible health plan, accountholders can still withdraw
                    previously contributed HSA money to pay for qualified medical expenses, or continue to let the funds grow tax-deferred.
                    Accountholders cannot, however, make contributions to the HSA unless an HSA-qualified insurance plan is in place.</p>

                    <p><strong>What are the income tax consequences after the HSA accountholder's death?</strong></p>
                    <p>Upon death, any balance remaining in the HSA becomes the property of a beneficiary named in the HSA paperwork. If the
                    beneficiary is the surviving spouse, distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to ordinary
                    income tax. If the beneficiary is a person other than the surviving spouse, the HSA ceases to be an HSA as of the date
                    of the accountholder's death, and the beneficiary is required to include in gross income the fair market value of the
                    HSA assets as of the date of death. This amount is reduced by any payments from the HSA made for the accountholder's
                    qualified medical expenses, if paid within one year after death.</p>

                    <p><strong>What reporting is required for an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Employer contributions to an HSA must be reported on the employee's Form W-2. The IRS will release forms and
                    instructions, similar to those required for MSAs, on how to report HSA contributions, deductions, and distributions
                    (withdrawals).</p>

                    <p id="S-taxAdvantageHsa"><strong>What are the federal tax advantages of an HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>HSA contributions are tax deductible and withdrawals used for qualified medical expenses are not subject to tax or
                    penalty. In addition, interest earned on HSA savings is tax-free if used to pay for qualified medical expenses. State
                    advantages will vary by state. Please see your tax advisor for additional information.</p>

                    <p><strong>Can HSA deductibles and out-of-pocket limits change?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, HSA deductibles, annual out-of-pocket maximums and annual contributions can change annually based upon changes in
                    the Consumer Price Index (CPI) issued by the Department of Labor.</p>

                    <p id="hsaSpecificQuestions" class="lead text-center"><strong>Employee/ Employer HSA Specific Questions</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>How can an employer afford to make HSA contributions for employees?</strong></p>
                    <p>Because HSAs must be coupled with a high deductible health plan, the health insurance premiums can be substantially
                    lower. Employers often find that these premium savings are large enough to cover the HSA contributions they make on
                    behalf of their employees, without increasing their current outlay for health care benefits.</p>

                    <p><strong>If the employer gives employees a bonus, can this amount be put into the HSA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Bonuses may be given and employees can choose to deposit some or all the amount into their HSA (as long as the maximum
                    annual contribution is not exceeded).</p>

                    <p><strong>Can the amount of employer funding vary based on classes of employees?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, there are comparability rules that must be followed when funding the HSA. In general, the employer must make
                    available comparable contributions on behalf of all employees with comparable coverage during the same period.
                    Contributions are considered comparable if they are either the same amount or the same percentage of the deductible
                    under the plan.</p>

                    <p id="S-withACheck"><strong>Can employees contribute directly to their account with a check?</strong></p>
                    <p>It depends on how the HSA is set up. If the HSA is offered through a cafeteria plan, contributions will be made by the
                    plan administrator. If the HSA is not set up with a cafeteria plan, an employee may make contributions with a check.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happens if a claim is incurred after the employee's policy add-on date, but prior to the HSA effective date?</strong></p>
                    <p>For contribution purposes, the HSA is effective the first of the month following an employee add-on to an HSA plan.
                    Qualified medical expenses will be reimbursed from the HSA retroactive to the date the employee was added to the HSA
                    plan.</p>
                    <p>Example: An employee who is added to the policy on 2/15 can begin contributing to the HSA on 3/1, but will still be
                    reimbursed for services rendered on 2/20.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happens to the HSA balance if the employee leaves the company?</strong></p>
                    <p>The HSA belongs to the employee. Therefore, unspent HSA funds remain with the individual. Accountholders can still use
                    their HSA money to pay for qualified medical expenses, or continue to let it grow tax-deferred. Accountholders cannot,
                    however, contribute to the HSA unless an HSA qualified insurance plan is in place.</p>

                    <p id="S-hraAndHsa"><strong>Is an HSA allowed for those small business owners who are not eligible for an HRA?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, an employer can set up an HSA for him/herself and an HRA for employees.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why does Assurant Health recommend using a different administrator for HRAs and HSAs?</strong></p>
                    <p>HRAs may require claims adjudication while HSAs do not. Employee Benefits Corporation (EBC) specializes in administering
                    FSAs and HRAs, both of which require claim adjudication, but they do not administer HSAs. HSAs do not require claims
                    adjudication but require banking arrangements so that funds may collect interest and in the future, have investment
                    options available.</p>

                    <p><strong>What employer discrimination rules apply to HSAs?</strong></p>
                    <p>If an employer makes HSA contributions, the employer must make available comparable contributions on behalf of all
                    "comparable participating employees" (i.e., eligible employees with comparable coverage) during the same period.
                    Contributions are considered comparable if they are either the same amount or same percentage of the deductible under
                    the high deductible health plan.</p>

                    <p>It is generally accepted that people prefer to make a living doing something they like. A hobby is an activity for which
                    you do not expect to make a profit. If you do not carry on your business or investment activity to make a profit, there
                    is a limit on the deductions you can take.</p>
                    <p>You must include on your return income from an activity from which you do not expect to make a profit. An example of
                    this type of activity is a hobby or a farm you operate mostly for recreation and pleasure. You cannot use a loss from
                    the activity to offset other income. Activities you do as a hobby, or mainly for sport or recreation, come under this
                    limit. So does an investment activity intended only to produce tax losses for the investors.</p>
                    <p>The limit on not-for-profit losses applies to individuals, partnerships, estates trusts, and S corporations. For
                    additional information on these entities, refer to business structures . It does not apply to corporations other than S
                    corporations.</p>
                    <p>In determining whether you are carrying on an activity for profit, all the facts are taken into account. No one factor
                    alone is decisive. Among the factors to consider are whether:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You carry on the activity in a business-like manner</li>
                        <li>The time and effort you put into the activity indicate you intend to make it profitable</li>
                        <li>You depend on income from the activity for your livelihood</li>
                        <li>Your losses are due to circumstances beyond your control (or are normal in the start-up phase of your type of business)</li>
                        <li>You change your methods of operation in an attempt to improve profitability</li>
                        <li>You, or your advisors, have the knowledge needed to carry on the activity as a successful business</li>
                        <li>You were successful in making a profit in similar activities in the past</li>
                        <li>The activity makes a profit in some years and the amount of profit it makes, and</li>
                        <li>You can expect to make a future profit from the appreciation of the assets used in the activity.</li>
