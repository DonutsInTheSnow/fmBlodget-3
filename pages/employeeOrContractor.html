                    <p>Before you can determine how to treat payments you make for services, you must first know the business relationship that
                    exists between you and the person performing the services. The person performing the services may be -</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">An independent contractor</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">A common-law employee (Employee)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In determining whether the person providing service is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that
                    provides evidence of the degree of control and independence must be considered.</p>
                    <p>It is critical that you, the employer, correctly determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or
                    independent contractors. Generally, you must withhold income taxes, withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes,
                    and pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. You do not generally have to withhold or pay any taxes on
                    payments to independent contractors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Caution:</strong> If you incorrectly classify an employee as an independent contractor, you can be held liable for employment
                    taxes for that worker, plus a penalty.</p>

                    <h4 id="S-independentContractor">Who is an Independent Contractor?</h4>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                        <li class="list-group-item">A general rule is that you, the payer, have the right to control or direct only the result of the work done by an
                        independent contractor, and not the means and methods of accomplishing the result.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Vera Elm, an electrician, submitted a job estimate to a housing complex for electrical work at $16 per hour for
                    400 hours. She is to receive $1,280 every 2 weeks for the next 10 weeks. This is not considered payment by the hour.
                    Even if she works more or less than 400 hours to complete the work, Vera Elm will receive $6,400. She also performs
                    additional electrical installations under contracts with other companies, that she obtained through advertisements. Vera
                    is an independent contractor.</p>
                    <p>Refer to <a href="" alt="Paying Independent Contractor">Paying Independent Contractor</a> if you need information on what your responsibilities are when paying
                    contractors.</p>

                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Under common-law rules, anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can control what will be done and
                        how it will be done. This is so even when you give the employee freedom of action. What matters is that you have the
                        right to control the details of how the services are performed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To determine whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor under the common law, the relationship of
                    the worker and the business must be examined. All evidence of control and independence must be considered. In an
                    employee-independent contractor determination, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and
                    degree of independence must be considered.</p>
                    <p>Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories: behavioral control,
                    financial control, and the type of relationship of the parties. Refer to Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax
                    Guide for additional information.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">Who is an Employee?
                        <li class="list-group-item">A general rule is that anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can control what will be done and
                        how it will be done.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Donna Lee is a salesperson employed on a full-time basis by Bob Blue, an auto dealer. She works 6 days a week,
                    and is on duty in Bob's showroom on certain assigned days and times. She appraises trade-ins, but her appraisals are
                    subject to the sales manager's approval. Lists of prospective customers belong to the dealer. She has to develop leads
                    and report results to the sales manager. Because of her experience, she requires only minimal assistance in closing and
                    financing sales and in other phases of her work. She is paid a commission and is eligible for prizes and bonuses offered
                    by Bob. Bob also pays the cost of health insurance and group-term life insurance for Donna. Donna is an employee of Bob
                    Blue.</p>

                    <h4 id="S-statutoryEmployees">Statutory Employees</h4>
                    <p>If workers are independent contractors under the common law rules, such workers may nevertheless be treated as employees
                    by statute ( statutory employees ) for certain employment tax purposes if they fall within any one of the following four
                    categories and meet the three conditions described under Social security and Medicare taxes, below.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">

                        merchandise for resale or supplies for use in the buyer s business operation. The work performed for you must be the
                        salesperson s principal business activity. Refer to the Salesperson section located in Publication 15-A, Employer s
                        Supplemental Tax Guide for additional information.</li>
