                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">Generally, there are two methods of deducting business use of a vehicle.
                        <li class="list-group-item">1. The “actual expenses” method involves keeping records of all expenses related to your vehicle such as gas,
                        maintenance, and depreciation. On a newer vehicle, the larger depreciation gives typically a larger deduction (early in
                        the depreciated life) over that of the “mileage method”. After the end of the depreciation on the vehicle, your only
                        deductions would be gas, maintenance, insurance etc. Depreciation can run as long as 5 years, typically is accelerated
                        and starts when the vehicle was “placed in service” for business use. Other options for depreciation include expensing
                        elections that further increase deductions in the first year(s). See <a href="#expensingVehicles" class="scrollto" alt="Expensing Vehicles">Expensing Vehicles</a> for more information.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">Remember that you still need to keep a log of your business mileage. Even if you use the “actual expense” method, you
                    need to have documentation of your business use. Mileage logs provide a method of allocation of expenses between
                    business and personal.
                        <li class="list-group-item">2. The second method is to use the “standard mileage rate”. This method involves multiplying your business miles by a
                        rate determined by the IRS. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p463.pdf" alt="IRS publication 463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publication 463</a> lists the standard mileage rates for the prior year. These change every year
                        and sometimes more than once a year. This is supposed to provide a deduction that, on average, is equal to the actual
                        expenses of running an auto, including depreciation, repairs, gas etc. If you use your vehicle for personal use, keep a
                        log of your business miles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember to keep track of tolls, parking, town tax and interest on your auto loan . These are deductible (for the
                    business portion) <strong>under either method</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Variations on the methods above include switching from one method to the other. One restriction for switching is that
                    you must have used straight-line depreciation under the “actual expense” method to switch to the “mileage method”.</p>
                    <p>You can imagine scenarios where one method would be advantageous over the other. The “actual expense” method might
                    provide a greater deduction with a new vehicle when depreciation expense is high. The “mileage method” might prove
                    better for an older vehicle that is reliable and has few repairs.</p>

                    <p>The most flexibility for depreciation occurs when a business purchases a vehicle over 6000# gross vehicle weight (GVW).
                    This includes cargo and most 3/4 ton trucks qualify. Generally, we are able to deduct the full cost of this type of
                    vehicle (considered business equipment) in the first year of service as long as there is enough net income from the
                    business. Other, more limited expensing elections are available for vehicles under 6000# GVW.</p>
                    <p>One drawback of this election is that there are no remaining deductions for depreciation in the following years (if you
                    elect to expense the entire amount). If business income increases, you may be paying a higher percentage of tax in
                    following years. Still many businesses have the most need for cash in the early years of their business.</p>
